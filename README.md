I will be using Particular Automation Setup for testing any web as well as mobile testing.
This will have to  perform functional and regression testing.
In order to get the most benefit out of it, we should have a good framework architecture right from the start. 
Connection with BrowserStack will help us to test on multiple OS .

Performance Testing using Jmeter

JMeter can be used to test the performance of both static resources such as JavaScript and HTML, as well as dynamic resources, such as JSP, Servlets, and AJAX.

JMeter can discover maximum number of concurrent users that your website can handle

JMeter provides a variety of graphical analyses of performance reports.

LoadRunner, a proprietary tool by Micro Focus, is used to test applications, measuring system behavior and performance under load. It can simulate thousands of users concurrently using application software, recording and later analyzing the performance of key components of the application.
